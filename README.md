# indi-2018w

Independent study work for the Winter 2018 term, supervised by Pippin Barr.

I'll keep some working [logs](logs.md) with day-to-day work, as well as some weekly [posts](posts) with more fleshed out reflections.

The idea is that projects and prototypes on the master branch will always be in a running / understandable state, even if very incomplete.
