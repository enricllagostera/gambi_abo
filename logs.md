After-meeting notes:

So, the basic idea is to choose some small existing games and make controllers for them, mostly with a focus on mechanical extensions for existing hardware (mouse, keyboards, joypads, etc).

Some of the guiding themes would be:

- Try to keep the mechanical part of the projects more elaborate and keep the electronics as off-the-shelf or hackable out of cheap devices as possible.
- Documentation and DIY creation of the controllers created.
- Make controllers for existing games as a form of commentary and extension of those games.
- Also, it would be a form of commentary/pushback on the Nintendo Labo commodification of DIY practices, as I'm hoping to make controllers for games that would never be allowed on a closed corporate platform and that are focused on political critique.

In a sense, it makes me think of [Rudeism](https://www.twitch.tv/rudeism)'s controllers for playing and streaming games, but in this case it's much more related to the content of the games and not humor and performance.

We also agreed on meeting next week for discussing the first developments on the project. I'm looking forward to this project!

Pre-meeting ideas & talking points:

- Choice of tech: JS (tools, libraries, the game itself) sounds like a better choice. I want to move away from using Unity as soon as possible.
- Project style: could it be a tool? A game? A generic alt controller? Hacking + homebrewing?
- Choice of subject: still kind of open, but I'm mostly interested in tackling contemporary political issues. Some topics that come to mind:
  - Nintendo "Labour", cooptation and hacking.
  - Working rights dismantling, austerity, neoliberalism.
  - Immigration, language barrier?
