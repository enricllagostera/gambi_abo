### 04 First prototyping session

Fist, I should note that this Wednesday I had a Skype call with Pedro Paiva and he agreed on me making a controller for [Carrocalipse](https://pedro-paiva.itch.io/carrocalipse). I'll also be sending him materials of the prototypes and tests. From this, I started thinking about ways to turn the 4-direction and 2 action buttons into a car-like interface that would be sort of unusable for the Sokoban-Frogger gameplay. I believe it serves as a commentary within the world of the game: cars ruled the world, and now a car is playing (or being used to play) a game about surviving without cars. ~ethics

I worked today on creating a first version of the controller. I focused mostly on the wheel, due to its complexity, as I have good ideas for how the up-down as throttle pedals or handles and the character changing as a gear shift. I'll work on these during next week.

There was a lot of back and forth in relation with how to translate the movement from a rotation to a vertical translation. I found an interesting way that is somewhat simple to assemble, but it will entail in keeping the axis parallel to the keyboard. The rotation axis will also need to have some slots for up-down free movement.  ~wheel

There was also a lot of testing with using rubber bands and other ways of joining pieces, as well as the possibilities of metal wires. It worked pretty well for this, as it didn't need to resist that much stress and was quick to rearrange and mold. I used quite a few pieces of cardboard to make 2D tests and basis for drawing and figuring out movements to try to implement in the keyboard device.

I considered the possibility of starting to use more elaborate electronics, but I've talked with Pippin and I'm leaning more towards the more mechanical focus. Keeping the electronic pieces intact works well. The cardboard contraption enveloping and extending the keyboard looks really nice and also connects well in relation with the Nintendo Labo "neatness" in fitting the JoyCon into the toys.

Another important aspect that I'm thinking for future design experiments is the sturdiness of the materials for the controller. I'll probably have to start experimenting with ways to make cardboard more resistant in a simple and DIY way. I'll do more research on that during the week.

As for documentation, we have tested tagging Pippin to notify about commits and notes, it seems to work alright. I've also taken some pictures of the setup, the prototype, and the work environment. I'm thinking that in future sessions it'd be good to do some form of cycle of annotations (at every X minutes / intervals, maybe?) and also making some more photo annotations to explain the details of the prototype. As soon as it's more usable, I'll also make some short videos. ~documentation ~meta

### 03 Consent from creators

After talking to Carol about the project idea, she raised the point of asking creators permission to create controllers on top of their games. I agree that that's a good idea, so I'll also start preparing a short description of what it is that I'm doing in this project to send to creators before start working on the prototypes. Also, I'll start by asking my friend Pedro Paiva if I can create a controller for one of his games (maybe Mario Empalado or Carrocracia). I guess this is also a good point to talk with Pippin.

### 02 After-meeting notes

So, the basic idea is to choose some small existing games and make controllers for them, mostly with a focus on mechanical extensions for existing hardware (mouse, keyboards, joypads, etc).

Some of the guiding themes would be:

- Try to keep the mechanical part of the projects more elaborate and keep the electronics as off-the-shelf or hackable out of cheap devices as possible.
- Documentation and DIY creation of the controllers created.
- Make controllers for existing games as a form of commentary and extension of those games.
- Also, it would be a form of commentary/pushback on the Nintendo Labo commodification of DIY practices, as I'm hoping to make controllers for games that would never be allowed on a closed corporate platform and that are focused on political critique.

In a sense, it makes me think of [Rudeism](https://www.twitch.tv/rudeism)'s controllers for playing and streaming games, but in this case it's much more related to the content of the games and not humor and performance.

We also agreed on meeting next week for discussing the first developments on the project. I'm looking forward to this project!

### 01 Pre-meeting ideas & talking points

- Choice of tech: JS (tools, libraries, the game itself) sounds like a better choice. I want to move away from using Unity as soon as possible.
- Project style: could it be a tool? A game? A generic alt controller? Hacking + homebrewing?
- Choice of subject: still kind of open, but I'm mostly interested in tackling contemporary political issues. Some topics that come to mind:
  - Nintendo "Labour", cooptation and hacking.
  - Working rights dismantling, austerity, neoliberalism.
  - Immigration, language barrier?
