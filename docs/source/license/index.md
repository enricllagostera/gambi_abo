**gambi_abo** is all about fostering a free and radical do-it-yourself culture. It is a free project and the different GambiCon designs, instructions for construction, diagrams, and images are meant to be as open as possible for remix and use. If you feel like extending them or making your own GambiCons, feel free to do it! There's no need for attribution. All I ask is that you don't "close" derivative works of the cardboard controllers featured here.

So, a summary:

- It's cool to remix and recreate GambiCons!
- It's ok to use GambiCons for commercial use.
- If you create a controller based specifically in the designs in gambi_abo, go for it, but keep it open to future modifications and access! That's what the "share alike" idea is.
- No need to give credit to me or to gambi_abo.
