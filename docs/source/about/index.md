# what?

**gambi_abo** is a series of DIY cardboard-based game controllers without gatekeepers. Each controller has accessible building instructions for how to create controllers using easy to find interface devices. With gambi_abo, you can make controllers for the games you choose, not the ones a *certain* company decides are the best for its platforms.

## focus on accessibility

Use of cheap materials, easy instructions, approachable and modifiable.

## minimal tinkering with electronics or software

No need to know how to solder, use a screwdriver or a multimeter. No need to buy electronic boards or specialized equipment. Use out-of-shelf or repurpose your electronics (like mouses, keyboards or gamepads).

## politics at the foreground

## free and open licenses

Don't worry about a big corporation telling you what you can and can't do with your cardboard controllers.
